# Web MIDI API Demo

If you have a MIDI input of some sort, [try out the demo here](https://ubercj.github.io/midi-demo/).

This is a very basic demo of how to use the Web MIDI API. I pulled in the [Tone.js library](https://tonejs.github.io/) to handle audio output so that the demo provides a bit better feedback.

*Please not that you will not be able to hear audio until you click the "Enable Audio" button.* Or at least this is definitely the case in Chrome or Chromium-based browsers. This is evidently a [Google Chrome policy](https://www.thecodecreative.com/blog/autoplay-policy-in-google-chrome) to improve user experience by preventing annoying autoplay audio.
